## Open-Source Version Changelog

## 🚀 Major Update v1.5.4

## Current Open-Source Version Video Demo

[<img width="503" height="351" alt="视频演示" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f186ce14-9ffc-4a29-8761-48bdd7c1ea16" />](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mB8dzfEw8?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.0&vd_source=6b1ff659dd5f04a92cc6d14061e8bb92)

- **Tool Consolidation & Refactoring**: Condensed the original 150+ tools into 50 highly reusable, high-coverage core tools, removing all dead and redundant code to greatly improve usability and maintainability.
- **Unified Opcodes**: All tools now use an "opcode + parameters" pattern, greatly simplifying the AI calling process, improving AI call success rates, reducing the number of AI calls, and cutting token consumption by 50%.
- **Comprehensive Prefab Upgrade**: Thoroughly fixed and refined all core prefab functionality — creation, instantiation, syncing, and referencing — with support for complex reference relationships, fully aligned with the official format.
- **Event Binding & Legacy Feature Completion**: Added and implemented event binding and other legacy features for nodes/components/assets, with all methods fully aligned with the official implementation.
- **Interface Optimization**: All interface parameters are clearer and better documented, making them easier for AI to understand and call.
- **Plugin Panel Optimization**: A cleaner panel UI with more intuitive operation.
- **Performance & Compatibility Improvements**: A more efficient overall architecture, compatible with all versions of Cocos Creator 3.8.6 and above.


## Tool System & Opcodes

- All tools are named using a "category_operation" convention, with parameters following a unified schema and support for switching between multiple opcodes (`action`), greatly improving flexibility and extensibility.
- The 50 core tools cover the full range of editor operations, including scenes, nodes, components, prefabs, assets, projects, debugging, preferences, the server, and message broadcasting.
- Example tool call:

```json
{
  "tool": "node_lifecycle",
  "arguments": {
    "action": "create",
    "name": "MyNode",
    "parentUuid": "parent-uuid",
    "nodeType": "2DNode"
  }
}
```

---

## Main Feature Categories (Partial Examples)

- **scene_management**: Scene management (get/open/save/create/close scenes)
- **node_query / node_lifecycle / node_transform**: Node querying, creation, deletion, and property changes
- **component_manage / component_script / component_query**: Adding/removing components, attaching scripts, component information
- **prefab_browse / prefab_lifecycle / prefab_instance**: Prefab browsing, creation, instantiation, syncing
- **asset_manage / asset_analyze**: Asset import, deletion, dependency analysis
- **project_manage / project_build_system**: Running and building the project, configuration information
- **debug_console / debug_logs**: Console and log management
- **preferences_manage**: Preferences
- **server_info**: Server information
- **broadcast_message**: Message broadcasting


### v1.4.0 - July 26, 2025

#### 🎯 Major Feature Fixes
- **Completely Fixed Prefab Creation**: Thoroughly resolved the issue of component/node/asset type references being lost during prefab creation
- **Correct Reference Handling**: Implemented a reference format fully consistent with manually created prefabs
  - **Internal References**: Node and component references inside the prefab are correctly converted to the `{"__id__": x}` format
  - **External References**: Node and component references outside the prefab are correctly set to `null`
  - **Asset References**: References to prefabs, textures, sprite frames, and other assets fully preserve the UUID format
- **Standardized Component/Script Removal API**: Removing a component/script now requires passing the component's cid (the `type` field) — the script name or class name can no longer be used. AI and users should first call `getComponents` to get the `type` field (cid), then pass it to `removeComponent`. This ensures 100% accurate removal of all component and script types and is compatible with all Cocos Creator versions.

#### 🔧 Core Improvements
- **Index Order Optimization**: Adjusted the prefab object creation order to ensure consistency with the standard Cocos Creator format
- **Component Type Support**: Extended component reference detection to support all component types prefixed with cc. (Label, Button, Sprite, etc.)
- **UUID Mapping Mechanism**: Refined the internal UUID-to-index mapping system to ensure reference relationships are correctly established
- **Property Format Standardization**: Fixed component property order and format, eliminating engine parsing errors

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Prefab Import Error**: Resolved the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_name')` error
- **Fixed Engine Compatibility**: Resolved the `placeHolder.initDefault is not a function` error
- **Fixed Property Overwriting**: Prevented critical properties such as `_objFlags` from being overwritten by component data
- **Fixed Reference Loss**: Ensured references of all types are correctly saved and loaded

#### 📈 Feature Enhancements
- **Complete Component Property Preservation**: All component properties are preserved, including private properties (such as `_group`, `_density`, etc.)
- **Child Node Structure Support**: Correctly handles prefab hierarchy structures and parent-child relationships
- **Transform Property Handling**: Preserves node position, rotation, scale, and hierarchy information
- **Debug Information Optimization**: Added detailed reference-handling logs to make issue tracking easier

#### 💡 Technical Breakthroughs
- **Reference Type Recognition**: Intelligently distinguishes between internal and external references to avoid invalid references
- **Format Compatibility**: Generated prefabs are 100% compatible with the format of manually created prefabs
- **Engine Integration**: Prefabs can be attached to scenes normally with no runtime errors whatsoever
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized the prefab creation process, improving processing efficiency for large prefabs

**🎉 Prefab creation is now fully functional, supporting complex component reference relationships and complete prefab structures!**

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for development (watch mode)
npm run watch

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new tool class in `source/tools/`
2. Implement the `ToolExecutor` interface
3. Register the tool in the `mcp-server.ts` initialization
4. The tool will automatically be exposed through the MCP protocol

### TypeScript Support

The plugin is written entirely in TypeScript, featuring:
- Strict type checking enabled
- Comprehensive type definitions for all APIs
- IntelliSense support during development
- Automatic compilation to JavaScript

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Server won't start**: Check port availability and firewall settings
2. **Tools not working**: Make sure a scene is loaded and the UUID is valid
3. **Build errors**: Run `npm run build` to check for TypeScript errors
4. **Connection issues**: Verify the HTTP URL and server status

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in the plugin panel to get detailed operation logs.
